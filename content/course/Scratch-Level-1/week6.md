Congratulations! You've made it to the final class of our Scratch programming course. In this class, you will have the opportunity to showcase all of the skills you've learned by creating a final project. 


## Project Guidelines

1. Your project should demonstrate your mastery of Scratch programming concepts. 

2. Your project should be a complete program that has a beginning, middle, and end. 

3. Your project can be a game, simulation, or any other type of program you choose. 

4. Your project should include a user interface and a scoring system. 

5. Your project should be something that you are proud of and want to share with others. 



## Tips for Success

1. Plan your project ahead of time. Consider the type of program you want to create and the programming concepts you want to incorporate. 

2. Break your project down into smaller parts and work on each part separately. 

3. Test your program frequently to ensure that it is working properly. 

4. Ask for help if you get stuck or need feedback. 



## Presentation Guidelines: 

1. You will have the opportunity to present your project to the class. 

2. You should prepare a brief explanation of your project, including the programming concepts you used and any challenges you faced. 

3. You should demonstrate your project to the class and allow time for questions and feedback. 


## Practice Examples 

1. Create a game where the player collects coins and avoids obstacles. 
2. Make a simulation of a natural phenomenon, such as weather patterns or animal behavior. 
3. Create a tool or app that solves a problem or makes a task easier. 
4. Develop a quiz or educational program on a topic you are passionate about. 
5. Create a choose-your-own-adventure story with different paths and endings.
