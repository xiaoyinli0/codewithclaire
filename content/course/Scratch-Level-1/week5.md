In this class, we'll explore more advanced programming concepts in Scratch, such as custom blocks, message passing, and cloning. 


##  Custom Blocks 

- Custom blocks are a way to group together a set of programming blocks so they can be reused in your program. 
- In Scratch, you can create custom blocks by selecting a set of blocks and using the "Make a Block" button. 
- Custom blocks make your program more organized and easier to understand. 


## Message Passing 

- Message passing is a way for sprites to communicate with each other. 
- In Scratch, you can use the "broadcast" block to send a message to other sprites, and the "when I receive" block to respond to a message. 
- Message passing is useful for creating multiplayer games or interactive simulations. 



##  Cloning  

- Cloning is a way to create multiple copies of a sprite in your program. 
- In Scratch, you can use the "create clone of" block to create a clone of a sprite, and the "delete this clone" block to delete a clone. 
- Cloning is useful for creating games or simulations with multiple identical objects. 



## Practice Examples: 

1. Create a custom block that moves a sprite a certain distance. 
2. Use message passing to create a multiplayer game where two players can control different sprites. 
3. Create a simulation where one sprite sends a message to another sprite to trigger an action. 
4. Use cloning to create multiple enemies in a game. 
5. Create a custom block that combines several programming blocks into one. 

That's it for Class 5! Practice using custom blocks, message passing, and cloning to create more complex programs in Scratch. We'll see you next time for even more Scratch fun!
