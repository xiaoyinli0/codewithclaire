Welcome to Scratch! 
<!--more-->


In this class, we'll learn what Scratch is and how to use it to create fun projects like animations and games. 


##  What is Scratch? 

- Scratch is a programming language that allows you to create interactive stories, games, and animations. 

- It was created by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

- Scratch uses a graphical interface, which means that instead of typing code, you can drag and drop blocks to create programs. 


## The Scratch Interface

When you open Scratch, you'll see the Scratch interface, which includes several parts: 

- **The Stage**: This is where your project will be displayed. 

- **The Sprite List**: This is where you can see all of the sprites (characters) in your project. 

- **The Block Palette**: This is where you can find all of the different blocks you can use to create your program. 

- **The Scripts Area**: This is where you drag and drop blocks to create your program. 



## Creating Your First Scratch Project 

Let's create our first Scratch project! Follow these steps: 

- Open Scratch. 

- Delete the cat sprite by right-clicking on it and selecting "delete." 

- Click on the "Choose a Sprite" button and select a new sprite (you can choose from the library or draw your own). 

- Drag some blocks from the Block Palette to the Scripts Area to make your sprite move, change color, or say something. 

- Click the green flag to see your program in action! 


## Introduction to Scratch Blocks 

- Scratch blocks are the building blocks of your program. 

- Blocks are categorized by color (motion blocks are blue, sound blocks are purple, etc.). 

- You can snap blocks together to create programs. 

- Some common blocks you'll use are: 

    + "move" blocks to make your sprite move. 

    + "say" blocks to make your sprite say something. 

    + "change color" blocks to change the color of your sprite. 


## Adding Sprites and Backgrounds 

- Sprites are the characters or objects in your project. 

- You can add sprites from the library or draw your own. 

- Backgrounds are the scenery in your project. 

- You can add backgrounds from the library or draw your own. 

That's it for our first class! Practice creating some simple programs using blocks and sprites, and we'll see you next time for more Scratch fun! 


## Practice problems

1. Create a dancing sprite: Use motion blocks to make a sprite move and look like it's dancing. You can add music or sounds to make it more fun. 

 
2. Make a talking sprite: Use the "say" blocks to make a sprite say something. You can add backgrounds and other sprites to create a scene. 

 
3. Create a game of catch: Use motion blocks to make one sprite throw an object (such as a ball) to another sprite, which catches it. You can use "if" blocks to make the catching sprite move to the right spot. 

 
4. Build an animation: Use motion and looks blocks to create a short animation. You can make a story or just create something fun to watch. 

 
5. Make a drawing program: Use motion blocks to make a sprite draw lines or shapes. You can change the color and size of the lines using "pen" blocks.
