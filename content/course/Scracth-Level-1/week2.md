In this class, we'll learn some basic programming concepts in Scratch, such as motion and looks blocks, changing sprite size and position, creating animation, and using sound and music blocks. 


## Using Motion and Looks Blocks 

- Motion blocks are used to move and control the position of sprites. 
- Some common motion blocks include "move," "turn," "go to," and "glide." 
- Looks blocks are used to control the appearance of sprites. 
- Some common looks blocks include "change size," "change color effect," "switch costume," and "next costume." 


## Changing Sprite Size and Position 

You can change the size and position of sprites using motion and looks blocks. 

- To move a sprite to a specific location, use the "go to x: y:" block. 
- To make a sprite grow or shrink, use the "change size by" block. 


## Creating Animation 

- Animation is the process of creating the illusion of motion by displaying a series of still images in rapid succession. 

- You can create animation in Scratch by changing the costume of a sprite over time. 

- To create animation, use the "next costume" block and the "wait" block to control the timing between costume changes. 


## Using Sound and Music Blocks 

Scratch includes blocks for adding sound effects and music to your projects. 

- You can use the "play sound" block to play a sound effect, and the "play note" block to play a musical note. 

- You can also use the "wait" block to control the timing of when sounds and music play. 

 

## Practice Examples: 

1. Create a sprite that moves across the screen when you click the green flag. 

2. Make a sprite change color and size when you press a key on the keyboard. 

3. Create a simple animation of a butterfly flapping its wings. 

4. Add sound effects to a game you created in Class 1. 

5. Create a musical program that plays a song when you press a button. 

That's it for Class 2! Practice creating programs using motion and looks blocks, changing sprite size and position, creating animation, and using sound and music blocks. We'll see you next time for more Scratch fun!
