Learn some advanced programming concepts.

In this class, we'll learn some advanced programming concepts in Scratch, such as variables, control structures, and events. 



## Variables 

- A variable is a value that can change during the course of a program. 
- In Scratch, you can create variables to store values, such as the score in a game. 
- Use the "set" block to set the value of a variable, and the "change" block to increase or decrease the value of a variable. 


## Control Structures 

- Control structures are used to control the flow of a program. 
- In Scratch, there are several control structures available, including "if-then" statements and loops. 
- Use the "if" block to create conditional statements, and the "repeat" block to create loops. 



## Events 

- Events are actions or occurrences that can trigger a program to perform a specific action. 
- In Scratch, there are several events available, such as the "when green flag clicked" and "when key pressed" events. 
- Use events to control when certain parts of your program execute. 



## Practice Examples: 

1. Create a program that counts how many times a sprite has been clicked. 

2. Create a game that keeps track of a player's score using a variable. 

3. Create a program that uses loops to repeat a sequence of actions. 

4. Add an "if-then" statement to a program you created in Class 2. 

5. Use an event to trigger an action in a program. 



That's it for Class 3! Practice using variables, control structures, and events to create more complex programs. We'll see you next time for even more Scratch fun!
