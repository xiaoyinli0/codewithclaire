In this class, we'll learn how to create games in Scratch using the programming concepts we've learned so far. We'll cover concepts such as game design, user interface, sprite interaction, and scoring systems. 

## Game Design 

Before you start programming your game, you need to have a plan for how the game will work and what it will look like. 

Consider the type of game you want to create, the objectives and challenges of the game, and the visual and audio elements you will include. 


## User Interface 

- The user interface is the way in which the player interacts with the game. 

- In Scratch, you can use buttons, text, and graphics to create a user interface. 

- Consider the layout of your game screen and how the player will navigate through the game. 


## Sprite Interaction 

- In many games, sprites interact with each other in some way. 

- In Scratch, you can use "if-then" statements to control sprite interactions. 

- Consider the behaviors and movements of your sprites and how they will interact with each other. 

## Scoring Systems 

- Scoring systems are used to keep track of a player's progress in a game. 

- In Scratch, you can use variables to keep track of a player's score. 

- Consider the actions that will earn the player points and how those actions will affect the game. 


## Practice Examples: 

1. Create a simple game where the player moves a sprite to collect objects and avoid obstacles. 

2. Make a game where the player needs to answer trivia questions to progress. 

3. Create a platformer game where the player must jump to avoid obstacles and reach the end. 

4. Add power-ups or bonuses to a game you created in Class 3. 

5. Create a game with multiple levels and increasing difficulty. 

That's it for Class 4! Practice designing and programming games in Scratch using the concepts we've learned so far. We'll see you next time for even more Scratch fun!
