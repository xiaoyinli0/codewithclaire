## Program overview

The 6-week kids Scratch coding class is a fun and interactive program designed to introduce children to the world of coding. Students will learn the basics of Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT, and use it to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations.

The class is held on Saturdays from 10:00-11:00 AM and starts on April 29th. Each session is one hour long and will be led by experienced instructors who will provide guidance and support throughout the learning process.

Over the course of six weeks, students will explore the fundamentals of coding, including logic, loops, and conditionals, and apply them to create their own Scratch projects. By the end of the class, students will have developed a range of coding skills and gained the confidence to continue exploring the exciting world of computer programming.

This class is perfect for kids aged 8-12 who are interested in coding and want to learn in a supportive and engaging environment. No previous coding experience is required, and all materials will be provided. Sign up now to give your child the opportunity to learn a valuable new skill!
