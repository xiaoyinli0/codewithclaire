Welcome to Code with Claire! This program is designed to provide children with an introduction to the world of computer programming in a fun and engaging way. Our goal is to help kids develop valuable skills in logic, problem-solving, and critical thinking, while also fostering their creativity and imagination.

Through interactive and hands-on activities, our experienced instructors will guide students through the basics of coding, using visual programming tools such as Scratch and Blockly. Kids will learn to create their own interactive stories, animations, and games, and gain the confidence to continue exploring the exciting world of computer programming.

Our classes are tailored for kids aged 6-11, and no previous coding experience is required. We believe that every child has the potential to become a skilled and confident coder, and we're excited to help them get there. Join us to give your child the opportunity to learn a valuable new skill and have fun while doing it!
